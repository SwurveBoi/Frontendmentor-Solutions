## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is what I learned during this challenge:

```css
Better understanding of how flexbox is utilized .prof-links {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1em;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I really wanna learn more about media queries as I can't really wrap my head around at the moment.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-properties-for-the-parentflex-container) - Really helped understand how to use flexbox layout.
